## Problem Understanding and Approach

The problem statement asks us to find the minimum number of operations required to transform an input sequence into a non-decreasing sequence. Two types of operations are allowed:

1. Increment an element by 1.
2. Double an element.

We can approach this problem using dynamic programming. We define a table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` stores the minimum number of operations required to transform the subsequence from index `i` to index `j` into a non-decreasing sequence.

To fill the `dp` table, we consider two cases for each subarray:

1. **No doubling within the subarray:** In this case, we can use the minimum of the following options:
    - `dp[i][j-1]`: The number of operations required to transform the subsequence from index `i` to index `j-1` into a non-decreasing sequence plus 1 (incrementing element `j`).
    - `dp[i+1][j]`: The number of operations required to transform the subsequence from index `i+1` to index `j` into a non-decreasing sequence plus 1 (incrementing element `i`).
2. **Doubling within the subarray:** In this case, we can double any element in the subarray. We try doubling each element `k` from index `i` to `j` and choose the option with the minimum number of operations.

After filling the `dp` table, the result is stored in `dp[0][n-1]`, where `n` is the length of the sequence.

## Time and Space Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity is `O(n^3)`, where `n` is the length of the sequence. This is because we consider all possible subarrays, and for each subarray, we consider all possible doubling operations.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is `O(n^2)`, as we use a 2D table to store the minimum number of operations for all possible subarrays.

## Well-Commented Implementation

```python
def min_operations(arr):
    """
    Finds the minimum number of operations required to transform an input sequence into a non-decreasing sequence.

    Args:
        arr (list): The input sequence.

    Returns:
        int: The minimum number of operations.
    """

    n = len(arr)
    dp = [[float('inf') for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]

    # Base cases
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i][i] = 0

    # Fill the dp table
    for length in range(2, n+1):
        for i in range(n-length+1):
            j = i + length - 1

            # No doubling within the subarray
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j-1] + 1, dp[i+1][j] + 1)

            # Doubling within the subarray
            for k in range(i, j+1):
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k-1] + 1 + (j-k)*arr[k]//arr[k-1])

    return dp[0][n-1]


# Example test cases
arr1 = [1, 2, 3]
arr2 = [1, 3, 2]
arr3 = [1, 5, 2, 4, 1]

print(min_operations(arr1))  # 0
print(min_operations(arr2))  # 1
print(min_operations(arr3))  # 4
```

## Alternative Approaches

- **Greedy Algorithm:** A greedy algorithm can be used to solve this problem. The algorithm starts by incrementing the smallest element in the sequence. If the sequence becomes non-decreasing, the algorithm stops. Otherwise, the algorithm doubles the smallest element and repeats the process. This algorithm has a time complexity of `O(n^2)`. However, it is not guaranteed to find the optimal solution.

- **Binary Search:** Binary search can be used to optimize the above greedy algorithm. Instead of doubling the smallest element, the algorithm can use binary search to find the optimal doubling point that minimizes the number of operations. This algorithm has a time complexity of `O(n log n)`.
