## Problem understanding and approach

The problem description is as follows:

> You are given a sequence of numbers. You can perform the following operation any number of times: select two adjacent numbers and replace them with their sum. Your task is to find the minimum number of operations required to make the sequence strictly increasing.

We can solve this problem using dynamic programming. Let dp[i] be the minimum number of operations required to make the sequence strictly increasing up to the i-th element. We can compute dp[i] as follows:

```
dp[i] = min(dp[i-1], dp[i-2]) + 1
```

The first term dp[i-1] represents the case where we do not perform any operation on the i-th element. The second term dp[i-2] represents the case where we perform an operation on the (i-1)-th and i-th elements. We choose the minimum of these two values because we want to find the minimum number of operations required.

## Time and space complexity analysis

The time complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the length of the sequence. The space complexity is O(n), since we need to store the dp array.

## Well-commented implementation

```python
def min_operations(nums):
    """
    Find the minimum number of operations required to make the sequence strictly increasing.

    Args:
        nums (list): The sequence of numbers.

    Returns:
        int: The minimum number of operations required.
    """

    n = len(nums)
    dp = [0] * n

    for i in range(1, n):
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 1
        if i >= 2:
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i-2] + 1)

    return dp[n-1]


# Example test cases
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(min_operations(nums))  # 0

nums = [1, 3, 2, 4, 5]
print(min_operations(nums))  # 1

nums = [1, 5, 2, 4, 3]
print(min_operations(nums))  # 2
```

## Alternative approaches

Another approach to solve this problem is to use a greedy algorithm. The greedy algorithm works as follows:

1. Initialize a variable i to 1.
2. While i is less than the length of the sequence:
    1. If the current element is greater than or equal to the previous element, increment i.
    2. Otherwise, add 1 to the minimum number of operations and increment i.

The greedy algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1).
