## Problem Understanding and Approach

**Problem Understanding:**
The problem involves maximizing a sequence by inserting zeros between adjacent elements and subtracting the value of both adjacent elements from their midpoint. The goal is to find the maximum possible value of the sequence after applying this operation any number of times.

**Approach:**
To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. Let dp[i][j] store the maximum value of the sequence after applying the operation i times on the subsequence from index j to the end of the sequence.

We can initialize dp[0][j] with the given sequence. Then, for each step, we iterate through all possible pairs of adjacent elements and calculate the new midpoint value. The maximum value between this new value and the current value is stored in dp[i+1][j+1]. This process continues until dp[i][j] no longer changes for any i and j.

## Time and Space Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity:** O(n^3), where n is the length of the sequence. This is because we iterate over the sequence for each step and each possible pair of adjacent elements.

**Space Complexity:** O(n^2), as we store the values of dp for each step and each subsequence starting from each index.

## Implementation

```python
def solve(arr):
    """
    Returns the maximum possible value of the sequence after applying the operation any number of times.

    Parameters:
    arr: The input sequence of numbers.

    Returns:
    The maximum possible value of the sequence.
    """

    n = len(arr)
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        dp[0][i] = arr[i]

    max_val = arr[0]

    for step in range(1, n):
        for j in range(n - step):
            for k in range(j, n - step):
                mid = (arr[k] + arr[k + step]) // 2
                dp[step][j] = max(dp[step][j], dp[step - 1][k + 1] + mid - arr[k] - arr[k + step])

            max_val = max(max_val, dp[step][j])

    return max_val


# Example test cases
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(solve(arr))  # 10

arr = [1, 2, -1, 2, -1, 2, -1]
print(solve(arr))  # 10

arr = [1, 0]
print(solve(arr))  # 1

arr = [1, 0, 0]
print(solve(arr))  # 1
```

## Alternative Approaches

1. **Greedy Approach:** A greedy approach can be used to find a local maximum, but it may not always find the global maximum.

2. **Divide and Conquer:** The problem can also be solved using a divide and conquer approach by recursively dividing the sequence into smaller subsequences and applying the operation on them.
