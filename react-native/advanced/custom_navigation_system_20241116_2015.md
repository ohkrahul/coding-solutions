# Custom Navigation System

## Difficulty: advanced

## Problem Description
Implement a custom navigation system with animations...

## Solution
### Initial Approach and Thought Process

- The first step is to understand the problem statement which is to create a custom navigation system with animations. We can break this down into a few key components:
  - A custom navigation component that will be responsible for handling the navigation and animations.
  - A custom transition component that will be responsible for the animations between screens.
  - A custom stack navigator that will manage the stack of screens and handle the navigation between them.
- Once we have a basic understanding of the problem statement, we can start to think about the implementation. The first step is to create a custom navigation component.

### Complete Implementation with Comments

**Custom Navigation Component**
```javascript
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from "react";
import { Animated, View } from "react-native";

const CustomNavigation = ({ children }) => {
  const translateX = useRef(new Animated.Value(0)).current;

  useEffect(() => {
    // Handle animations here
  }, [translateX]);

  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      {children}
    </View>
  );
};
```

**Custom Transition Component**
```javascript
import React from "react";
import { Animated } from "react-native";

const CustomTransition = ({ children, translationX }) => {
  return (
    <Animated.View style={{ transform: [{ translateX }] }}>
      {children}
    </Animated.View>
  );
};
```

**Custom Stack Navigator**
```javascript
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { createStackNavigator } from "@react-navigation/stack";

const CustomStack = createStackNavigator();

const CustomStackScreen = ({ navigation }) => {
  const [screenIndex, setScreenIndex] = useState(0);

  const transitionX = useRef(new Animated.Value(0)).current;

  useEffect(() => {
    // Handle animations here
  }, [screenIndex, transitionX]);

  return (
    <CustomNavigation navigation={navigation}>
      <CustomStack.Navigator>
        <CustomStack.Screen name="Screen1">
          {() => <CustomTransition translationX={transitionX} />}
        </CustomStack.Screen>
        <CustomStack.Screen name="Screen2">
          {() => <CustomTransition translationX={transitionX} />}
        </CustomStack.Screen>
      </CustomStack.Navigator>
    </CustomNavigation>
  );
};
```

### Edge Cases and Error Handling

- One potential edge case is if the user tries to navigate to a screen that doesn't exist. In this case, we can throw an error or display a custom error screen.
- Another potential edge case is if the animation doesn't complete properly. In this case, we can try to restart the animation or display a custom error message.

### Testing Strategy

- We can create unit tests for each of the custom components to ensure that they are working as expected.
- We can also create integration tests to ensure that the custom navigation system is working correctly with the rest of the application.

### Performance Considerations

- The performance of the custom navigation system can be impacted by a number of factors, including the number of screens, the complexity of the animations, and the performance of the device.
- To improve the performance, we can try to use efficient animations, avoid unnecessary re-renders, and use a performant animation library.
