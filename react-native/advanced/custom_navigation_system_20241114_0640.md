# Custom Navigation System

## Category: react-native
## Difficulty: advanced

## Problem Description
Implement a custom navigation system with animations...

## Solution
**Initial Approach and Thought Process**

The first step is to determine the architecture of the custom navigation system. We need to decide on how it will handle navigation, screen transitions, and animations. I decided to use a stack-based approach, where each screen is pushed onto a stack and popped when transitioning back.

**Complete Implementation**

```
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { NavigationContainer, StackActions } from '@react-navigation/native';

export default function CustomNavigationSystem() {
  const [stack, setStack] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Handle back button press
    // This is called when the back button is pressed
    BackHandler.addEventListener('hardwareBackPress', () => {
      // Remove the current screen from the stack
      const newStack = [...stack];
      newStack.pop();
      setStack(newStack);

      return true; // Prevent default behavior
    });
  }, []);

  const push = (screen, animation) => {
    // Push a new screen onto the stack
    const newStack = [...stack];
    newStack.push(screen);
    setStack(newStack);

    // Perform animation
    // This can be implemented using a library like react-native-screens
    // It should include animations like fade in/out or slide in/out
  }

  const pop = (animation) => {
    // Pop the current screen from the stack
    const newStack = [...stack];
    newStack.pop();
    setStack(newStack);

    // Perform animation
  }

  return (
    <NavigationContainer>

      <Stack.Navigator>
        {stack.map((screen) => (
          <Stack.Screen key={screen} name={screen} component={screen} />
        ))}
      </Stack.Navigator>

    </NavigationContainer>
  );
}
```

**Edge Cases and Error Handling**

There are a few edge cases that need to be handled:

* If the stack is empty, popping the current screen should not cause an error.
* If a screen is pushed onto the stack that is already on the stack, the stack should not be duplicated.

**Testing Strategy**

The navigation system can be tested by creating unit tests for the push and pop methods. The tests should verify that the stack is updated correctly and that the animations are performed as expected.

**Performance Considerations**

The performance of the navigation system can be improved by using a virtualized list to render the stack of screens. This will prevent the entire stack from being rendered at once, which can improve performance on devices with limited memory.
